# Personal Mail Backup

This repository contains configuration files and other tools I use to manage my personal email backup. Also used a bit as a personal playground and learning space.


## Backup

Uses [offlineimap](https://github.com/OfflineIMAP/offlineimap3) to generate a backup of an IMAP server.

See [my blogpost](https://www.dermitch.de/post/imap-backup-with-offlineimap/) for details about this project.
